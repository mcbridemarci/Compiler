# Programming Assignment #1

## Task
In this first assignment, use a combination of Flex and Bison to build and test a scanner for the C- language. The scanner will be named c-.

#### The Flex Part 
Build a Flex scanner that returns a token class for each token in the C- grammar.

#### The Bison Part 
Build a Bison parser that accepts any stream of legal tokens from the scanner.

## Files
* parser.l - contains the flex code
* parser.y - contains the bison code
* scanType.h - contains the declaration of either a struct or class that is used to pass your token information back from the scanner.
* makefile - execute to build your c-.
