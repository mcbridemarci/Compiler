# Programming Assignment #1

## Task
In this programming assignment, you will work on the following tasks:
* Tweak-in some improvements to the interface.
* Use Flex and Bison to build a parser for the C- language.
* While doing the parsing, you will construct the syntax tree. This is not the annotated
syntax tree but just the initial abstract syntax tree.
* You will write the procedure printTree which will print out the tree exactly as I
have in the examples I give below. Almost the same format is not good enough. 

## Files
* parser.l - contains the flex code
* parser.y - contains the bison code
* scanType.h - contains the declaration of either a struct or class that is used to pass your token information back from the scanner.
* makefile - execute to build your c-.
